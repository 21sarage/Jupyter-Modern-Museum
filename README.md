# Jupyter-Modern-Museum

The central theme of the first part of this notebook is the analysis of three of the most famous works of art in history, all belonging to different artistic currents, and consequently made with different techniques and different objectives by the authors; The aim is to show how these objectives can be emphasized through a color quantization operation, carried out by implementing the "k-means" algorithm, so as to obtain a more "simple" image from the chromatic point of view, bringing each pixel into the nearest color of the k (arbitrarily chosen number) most frequent colors in the painting. This image will be superimposed on the black edges emphasized to get a cartoonized version of the original.

The second part, a bit more technical in appearance, takes this cartoonized image and allows to create a "pop art" version giving white paper to those who use the notebook on the colors to change and with which colors replace them.
